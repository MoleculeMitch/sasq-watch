Welcome to Sasqwatch!
https://sasq-watch.herokuapp.com/

This application is dedicated to the investigation of bigfoot. All of Sasq-Watchâ€™s 5000 data points are sampled from the BFRO (Bigfoot Field Research Organization), and span over the last 100 years. The BFRO is widely accepted as the most credible investigative network involved in the scientific study of Bigfoot.

Features:
-Data is organized by sightings per year, by state popularity, and by season/month
-Data is visualy expressed using Python Graphing Gallery
-PostgreSQL database to manage user logins, bookmarked sightings, and custom notes
-This app follows the CRUD(Create Read Update Delete) paradigm

In theory, interacting with Sasq-Watch allows users to make predictions as to when and where communities of Bigfoot might reside, if they exist.

Happy exploring!
